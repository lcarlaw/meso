These GR-Placefiles are produced using 13-km RAP data each hour, except for the 00 and 12z
cycles when HRRR data is used due to timeliness considerations (HRRR data is upscaled to the
same 13-km grid spacing as the RAP). Each grid point is run through SHARPpy's parcel
functions. While these fields will not exactly match those on the SPC mesoanalysis page,
they should generally be close.

These files should be available by :05 after the hour. The 1 and 2-hour forecasts are
linearly interpolated in time to create two additional analyses valid at the bottom of the
current hour and top of the next hour. These will automatically time-match in GR at :15 and
:45.

In the event of a NOMADS outage, this will fall back to searching the back-up FTPPRD site and
finally a Google Cloud repository for realtime HRRR data. Data availability is not guaranteed,
however, so be sure to check the timestamps in the GR Placefile Window!
